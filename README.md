## Description
For our final project, we decided to create an e-commerce mattress store that allows customers to view, purchase, and ship mattresses that they are in the market for. Customers that are on the hunt for a new mattress will be able to use our website to filter mattresses to suit their preferences, ranging from:
* Brand
* Size
* Firmness
* Price
Once a customer has chosen their mattress of choice, they will need to create an account using their email address and a password of their choice, allowing them to keep track of their purchase once it has been shipped, and to keep their billing/shipping addresses associated with their account. Payment is handled by Stripe, using their API to take payment once at the checkout phase of the transaction.

## Technologies Used
The list of technologies we used for our project is as follows:
* React.js
* GraphQL
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose ODM
* Heroku
* Stripe API
* Emotion CSS
